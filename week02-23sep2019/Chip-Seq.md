**ChIP-Seq**

DNA with bound proteins are digested. Then, selected proteins and their bound DNA can be isolated using Chromatin Immunopercipitation (ChIP). The isolated DNA can then be sequenced using high troughput sequencing methods and from there we can draw conclusions on the binding sites of the proteins in question.

*To-Do* make the link (technology -> application -> statistics)

ChIP-Seq can be used to determine Binding sites of many different proteins, but most interesting are Transcription factors, since we could draw conclusions about gene activity, if we can understand TF-binding patterns. 
The sensitivity of the method depends higly on sequencing depth used.
