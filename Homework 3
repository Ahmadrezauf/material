#Methyl-Seq

RBetschart: Raphael Betschart

## Technology:
- Methyl-Seq is a sequencing method based on cytosine methylation. It is possible to do both genome-wide analysis and targeted approaches.

## Application:
Methyl-Seq analyzes methylation patterns of CpG (Cytosine nucleotide followed by Guanine), CHH and CHG regions.

##  Statistics:
Differential methylation analysis of multiple sample groups is a method that can be used to compare methylation of different samples.
