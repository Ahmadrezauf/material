Methyl-Seq

Methyl-Seq is a sequencing method based on cytosine methylation. It is possible to do both genome-wide analysis and targeted approaches.

Advantages of Methyl-Seq:

- Small amounts of DNA are sufficient to capture full sample diversity
- Analyzation of CpG (Cytosine nucleotide followed by Guanine), CHH and CHG regions
